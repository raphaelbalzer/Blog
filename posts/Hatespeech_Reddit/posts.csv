[It appears Drake is trying to clear 'Say What's Real' off his So Far Gone mixtape. This song samples/remixes Kanye's 'Say You Will'](https://i.imgur.com/Pu6G3DV.jpg)

Kanye took this as the opportunity to air out Drake, citing all the sneak disses and behind the scenes threats he's alleged that he's made. In the span of his rants, he's claimed Drake bought out Pusha T's front rows in Toronto to cause a brawl, he sneak dissed him on SICKO MODE, Drake bullies people with mental health issues, only for Drake to end the first rant by calling him.

Kanye claimed 'Mission Accomplished' and the sample was not cleared. A couple hours later, Kanye is back and claiming Drake called to threaten his life, where he restated that XXX is dead and 6ix9ine are already in jail, only difference is Kanye is a family man. Kanye says he paved the way for Drake to come up in rap, and he shouldn't be giving the guy with pink polos the tough talk now. Essentially, respect your elders.

And then gives a further deep dive into SICKO MODE, calling out Travis for allowing that to come out as a diss to his brother-in-law. Retracts some of the harsher statements which are mirrored below, but then tries to end (as of now?) on a positive note, saying to respect him while he's still here.

"The Basketball world reacts to the passing of Kobe Bryant","2020-01-26",1580073105,"The Basketball world reacts to the passing of Kobe Bryant","Earlier today it was reported that Lakers legend and future inner-circle hall of famer, Kobe Bryant passed away in a helicopter accident. He was accompanied by one of his daughters, Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant, and seven others, all who also perished in the crashed. They were on their way to a basketball practice at Kobe's own Mamba Sports Academy.

Kobe Bryant was not only a Lakers icon but an icon across the NBA who transcended the sport and became a household name for millions of people across the globe. He is survived by his wife, Vanessa, and his three living daughters, Natalia (17), Bianka (3), and Capri (7 months).

The impact of today's tragic crash reverberated throughout the NBA and far beyond. Below I have compiled a list of just some of the reactions from in and outside of the basketball world on this monumental loss.

I love you and you will be missed. My condolences go out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW.
[Pau Gasol](https://twitter.com/paugasol/status/1221538421363089409) | Beyond devastated... my big brother... I cant, I just cant believe it
[Shareef O'Neal](https://twitter.com/SSJreef/status/1221531785273569280) | Literally this morning you reached out to me.... I love you forever unc. I love you.
[Trae Young](https://twitter.com/TheTraeYoung/status/1221538701353848834) | This S*** cant be real... this the first moment I was able to meet Gianna Maria, shes been to only 3 games this year... 2 of them were mine... She told me I was her favorite player to watch. I cant believe this. Rest Easy Gigi.
[Michael Jordan](https://twitter.com/esteep/status/1221564272603430918) | I am in shock over the tragic news of Kobe's and Gianna's passing. Words can't describe the pain I'm feeling. I loved Kobe - he was like a little brother to me. We used to talk often and I will miss those conversations very much. He was a fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force. Kobe was also an amazing dad who loved his family deeply - and took great pride in his daughter's love for the game of basketball. Yvette joins me in sending my deepest condolences to Vanessa, the Lakers organization and basketball fans around the world.
[Magic Johnson](https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/1221560645323124736) | My friend, a legend, husband, father, son, brother, Oscar winner and greatest Laker of all-time is gone. Its hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.

Our hearts &amp; prayers to Vanessa &amp; his girls. Kobe Bryant you were my biggest fan, but I was yours.
[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](https://twitter.com/kaj33) | Most people will remember Kobe as the magnificent athlete who inspired a whole generation of basketball players. But I will always remember him as a man who was much more than an athlete.
[Adam Silver](https://twitter.com/IanBegley/status/1221558854342860807) | The NBA Family is devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna. For 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning. He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary: five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals. But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability. He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Vanessa, and their family, the Lakers organization and the entire sports world.
[NBPA](https://twitter.com/TheNBPA/status/1221544709115514885) | We are stunned and devastated by the news of the sudden passing of Kobe Bryant. Words cannot express his impact on our Players, the NBA and the game of basketball. This is a monumental loss for the entire basketball community and our hearts are quite simply broken. We send love and prayers out to his wife Vanessa and the entire family.

[Andrew Wiggins](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zLBn2hc03/) | I grew up watching and admiring your game. Your impact goes beyond the basketball court from the way you carried yourself, and how you were with your family. It was an honor and privilege to get the opportunity to compete with you and even hear the way you spoke about me at such a young age in my career. My condolences goes out to the whole Bryant Family, friends, and loved ones of both Kobe and Gigi d.
[Lamar Odom](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zOpt5A3Nw/) | These picture are just the tip of the iceberg of our relationship. He taught me so many things in life that were necessary on and off the court. On the court he taught me how to carve out defenses and how to take my time. How to make winning my ultimate goal. Off the court he taught me to sign my own checks lol. Of course anyone who knows my story knows Ive suffered a lot of loss but the only loss I can compare this to is when I lost my son. Even though our relationship wasnt father/son, it was more like him being a teacher and me being his brother. Im glad I got to be the ying to your yang as far as the locker room was concerned. It was my pleasure. I couldnt even catch my breath today when I heard this news. I just knew if he was in a helicopter crash he would have been the one to survive. Somehow he would have jumped out and landed on his feet. Im sitting here thinking about when we would be in practice scrimmaging and you would start the jump ball off with elbowing Sasha in the chest. Like dude its 10:30 in the morning lol. You think watching him play was crazy, you gotta think in practice if you scored like 8-9 buckets throughout the practice you had a great practice. Ive seen him knock off 13-14 in a row in practice!!!! Im still waiting for the media to come out and say wrong report. No way God took my brother this early. I know I been through my own stuff in life with using drugs and not being good to myself. When I went through that Coma situation if God would have came to me and said we would take me and spare Kobe I would have rather that happened. In honor of my brother Im up at 4am tomorrow to get to the gym! Gigi gone give you buckets!!!! I love you brother =Â”=O<Ã¿=%

"Music elitism is getting annoying.","2021-12-26",1640515073,"Music elitism is getting annoying.","Yes, you can listen to Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Paul Anka and a lot of old school stuff. But that doesn't mean modern music is ""not real music"" and that music is getting worse. As a matter of fact, I should be able to listen to what I want and not feel judged.



Edit: Alright, this post is getting out of hand.

From people missing the point to people assuming things about my life, I've never felt so confused.

I'm French so bear with my broken English lol

As I said multiple times, I have a very eclectic music taste going from classical music to more contemporary stuff such as Serge Gainsbourg or Stevie wonder to the latest mainstream artists (Tyler the creator, Kanye west, even Billie Eilish). My point is that people are biased and refuse to listen to modern music. And yes, a lot of people might relate to the things I said which is why I received so much hate. 

For the people saying I don't know music.
I was in a conservatory (is that English? I mean music school)  from the age of 6 to 14, so, as you guys may have guessed, not long ago. I have learned music theory through classical music for years. I know most of the people reading this have also learned music the way I did so it's nothing special. But I'm just trying to explain that I am not an uncultured kid that only knows ""mumble autotuned rappers"" (?!) .

Now yes, I'm only 16, I don't have much experience. But that doesn't mean you should treat me like you were superior to me.

""Modern music has meaningless lyrics""
To pimp a butterfly by Kendrick Lamar is probably one of the most grandiose and profound albums I've ever heard in my life, both lyrically and musically. It was released in 2015. 

""Modern music is full of autotune""
I'm pretty sure the people who say this refer to Melodyne. Which, doesn't bother but can bother people and I fully understand. Now, autotune is mostly used for stylistic purposes, T-Pain has a really beautiful soulful voice, but uses autotune because it matches what he wants to make. Kanye's 808's and heartbreaks is mainly based on autotune and has set the standards for cloud rapping.

""Modern music is all the same"" 
This is probably the worse I got here. 
Let's run it back to the 80's, MOST mainstream songs were similar, the same mixing, the same annoying reverb on the snares, the same synths. Do I consider the 80's as a bad era for music ? Hell no, Michael Jackson's groundbreaking thriller album changed the music landscape with his music videos. Prince's 1999 album influenced a whole generation of artists and so many talents emerged in the music industry.

Now if we're going in the 2010's you can pretty much split it in half, from 2010-2015 the main genres in mainstream music were EDM pop and House, and from 2015-now the dominant genre is Hip-hop.
Two really different genres. We've got some pretty great mainstream albums this decades, An evening with Silk Sonic, Kids see ghosts, Good kid M.a.a.d city. These are all pieces of art that were highly streamed and mediatized.


I feel like when you grow up, you can't catch up with change and you start just hating on modern stuff or new generations, sometimes it's based on solid points, most of the time it's based on nothing.
I'm not gonna lie, this comment section got me scared as I don't want to end up hating on newer stuff when I grow old.

Also the Paul Anka slander is killing me lol","Music",3964,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/roujf1/music_elitism_is_getting_annoying/"

Happy Halloween!

I'm Jon Schnitzer, director/producer of ""HAUNTERS: The Art Of The Scare"" a film about how boo-scare mazes for Halloween have spawned a controversial sub-culture of ""full contact"" extreme terror experiences, the visionaries who dedicate their lives to scaring people, and why we seek out these kind of experiences - especially in scary and unpredictable times.  

No surprise this Halloween is projected to be the biggest ever and that these kind of experiences are starting to be offered year round.

I filmed inside McKamey Manor, the most controversial extreme haunt in the world, infamous for going on for 8 hours, having no safe word and even waterboarding people. I also got unprecedented access to the creative geniuses behind Blackout, Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights, Knotts Scary Farm, Delusion and more traditional haunts too. HAUNTERS also features horror visionaries John Murdy (HHN) Jen Soska &amp; Sylvia Soska (American Mary / Hellevator), Jason Blum (producer of The Purge, Happy Death Day, Insidious, Sinister), Jessica Cameron (Truth or Dare / Mania) and more.  

I always loved Halloween and horror movies since I was a kid, so I wanted to highlight the haunters as the artists they are, to capture the haunt subculture at a time when more and more people are seeking extreme ""scare-apy"", and to spark a debate about how far is too far.

But, first and foremost, I wanted to make a movie that would entertain people, so I have been thrilled to get so many rave reviews since premiering at Fantastic Fest last month - ""9 out of 10"" - Film Threat, ""An absolute blast"" - iHorror, ""Genuinely petrifying"" - Bloody Disgusting, ""Shockingly entertaining"" - Dread Central, ""An intoxicating study of our relationship with fear."" - Joblo, and more!  

HAUNTERS was a successfully funded Kickstarter project, that I made for under $100,000.  

My passion for this project also inspired some of my favorite composers and musicians to come on-board to create a killer soundtrack - Dead Man's Bones (Ryan Gosling &amp; Zach Shields, who's also from the band Night Things and co-writer of the films Krampus and the upcoming Godzilla) and Emptyset, and an original score by Jonathan Snipes (Room 237 &amp; The Nightmare), Alexander Burke (recorded with Fiona Apple, David Lynch and Mr. Little Jeans) and Neil Baldock (recorded with Kanye West, Radiohead and Wilco).

Recording Academy President and CEO Harvey Mason, jr. has defended the Academy after Marilyn Manson and Louis C.K. received nominations for next years Grammy Awards. Mason told TheWrap that personal and legal matters wont affect artists eligibility, suggesting that the Recording Academy would exercise more control over Grammy night invitees. Manson is the subject of multiple sexual assault lawsuits, and was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Rap Song for his respective contributions to Kanye Wests Donda and Jail. C.K., who was nominated for Best Comedy Album, has admitted numerous instances of sexual misconduct.

We wont restrict the people who can submit their material for consideration, Mason told TheWrap. We wont look back at peoples history, we wont look at their criminal record, we wont look at anything other than the legality within our rules of, is this recording for this work eligible based on date and other criteria. If it is, they can submit for consideration.

The Grammys chief continued: What we will control is our stages, our shows, our events, our red carpets. Well take a look at anyone who is asking to be a part of that, asking to be in attendance, and well make our decisions at that point. But were not going to be in the business of restricting people from submitting their work for our voters to decide on.","Music",2642,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/r17kr7/grammys_ceo_says_we_wont_look_at_peoples_history/"

It was the annual talent show for our high school. Every student had to attend the show as an audience including me so I thought it might be a great opportunity for me to show the whole school that I am a funny rebellious kid and they should l love me. 

I spent weeks planning it, I would run up the stage and tell my very own written joke. It all seemed so great in my head. Everyone would be bored out of their minds at the performance and I would save the day by making everyone laugh and cheer. Then the time came. It was a normal average singing performance by one of the senior girl. Crowd was quiet, so I assumed they were bored. I got up from the crowd, ran up the fucking stage like Kanye West, stole the mic from the poor girl who just wanted to sing. And at the top of my fucking lungs I shouted. ""Hello everyone, I am Shake..Spear"" while doing masturbation gesture. Nobody laughed.Nobody cheered. I got suspended for a 2 days and detention for a whole month. And 6 years of hell. 

TL:DR I delivered a bad pun in front of my whole school resulting in suspension and detention.  ","tifu",1002,"https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8390y0/tifu_by_embarrassing_myself_in_front_of_the_whole/"

So I was on Facebook and I scrolled to a post that said Raekwon changed his phone number. I thought it was for booking or whatever, but I was bored so I called the number. I didn't get an answer, but he texted asking who I was. Me, who probably should've just said that I'm a fan, said that I'm Kanye West. So he was pretty much like ""no you're not. You know what? I'm just going to call you."" So I frantically installed a call recorder app to catch the conversation that lasted under 30 seconds. He was nice as all hell considering I kind of adopted a jerky tone due to nervousness (?) and I was wasting his time. 

[Here's the call.](https://vocaroo.com/faDfc7ufPVW)

I have a hunch that since his Facebook page was recently hacked, Facebook made him give his number as some sort of a verification, but he accidentally made it public. Because like ten minutes after the call, I noticed that the number was taken down. I'm not going to attempt to call him back or whatever and I'm not giving the number up, because he probably feels annoyed already.

This years Coachella Valley Music and Arts and Stagecoach festivals will no longer require attendees to wear masks or provide negative COVID-19 test results, Rolling Stone and Variety point out. Stagecoach announced the news via social media earlier today. Coachella did not make an announcement via social media, but the health and safety guidelines on the festival website has been updated to communicate the new guidelines. In accordance with local guidelines, there will be no vaccination, testing or masking requirements at Coachella 2022, it reads. Pitchfork has reached out to festival organizers Goldenvoice for further information and comment.

Back in October, Coachella and Stagecoach announced that they would no longer require full vaccination for attendees at the 2022 festival. The new changes in COVID-19 protocol follow Californias statewide termination of mask mandates, which went into effect today. The updated guidelines will still require vaccinated people to wear masks in some settings, such as K-12 schools, on public transportation, and in healthcare settings. Masks will be required for unvaccinated people inside of churches. There will no longer be a requirement to provide a negative test result to visit hospitals and nursing homes.

Elsewhere in its health and safety guidelines, Coachellas website states that protocol may change at any time as determined by federal, state or local government agencies. These changes may include proof of vaccination and/or negative COVID-19 test, and other protective measures such as requiring attendees to wear face coverings.

Coachella is scheduled for the weekends of April 15-17 and 22-24, 2022. Kanye West, Billie Eilish, and Harry Styles are set to headline. Both the 2020 and 2021 editions of the festival were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Music",3096,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/stfm5n/coachella_drops_covid_restrictions_wont_require/"

EDIT: 

not to sound condescending but i'm just gonna add a couple of discussion questions here incase y'all get tired of 'father stretch my anus' jokes and lyric chains:

What direction do you think ~~this album is~~ these albums are going to take? What direction would you like to see them take? Do you think the length of the album is good or bad? What influences are we supposed to see on the album? Do you think he's gonna release it in time?


We know he's let Charlamagne hear some of it, and I believe Nas reportedly was working on something with Kanye too, what do you think it is? 

edit 2: 

why didn't kanye tweet the name of his own album? I'm assuming the second one is Kids See Ghost - Kids See Ghost

Why is ghost singular? do you expect both the drop? which one do you think will sell more?

"I am in my last hour as a teenager. I wanted to pour my heart out to you all and give some advice that I have learned. I hope this helps you","2021-04-23",1619154041,"I am in my last hour as a teenager. I wanted to pour my heart out to you all and give some advice that I have learned. I hope this helps you","First of all thank you all for all that you have done. You have provided me with countless entertainment and a feeling of belonging on this site. Yes, sometimes I can be annoyed with the things that come out of this sub but overall I am happy and proud of you all. 

Before I forever transition out of being a teenager I wanted to leave you all with some advice that I have learned as I have gone through life. (I apologize for any typos. Typing as an American all of these things might not apply) I do not have the handbook for life, not everything will apply 100% to you or those around you.  My life isnt yours. It I have watched and learned from people and life and found that these things may help

**Intentionally cultivate your interests** . As you try to navigate life the only thing you truly have is yourself. If you spend your time doing things arbitrarily, when rubber meets the road you will be left behind, and it will not feel good, and you will know it. This will help you become valuable to the world in terms of jobs, friendships, intrinsic confidence, dating, and long term joy.  Well trained and cared for animals and being able to cook good food make you appealing in the dating world and keep life interesting. If you can, learn a language and try out music. I promise life with those two things is so much more fulfilling. Work hard, work with a goal in mind, work intelligently and work well. Know you value, you are a person, not a capitalist number. You work to live, not vice versa. Dont worry about being a part of the latest trend of popular things. Be yourself because only you have to live life being you.

**Emotions** - as a teenager your emotions and logic are bound to be like a frantic squirrel bouncing around a cage. This makes it difficult for anyone to instill any sort of logic/ discipline into you, especially if you are a younger teenager. Listen carefully even when you feel you are being wronged or like no one understands you. It could be the difference between you having to learn the hurtful way, and succeeding. Do not quarrel unnecessarily. Do not be easily offended. Learn to not take things personally and understand you are not the most important person in the world. Understand that people believe in different things and this doesnt make them bad, even if they offend you. It makes the world what it is, dynamic, and diverse. Learn to objectively view your emotions, and write them down. It will help you analyze them and push forward in life. It it wont matter in a year or so dont fret over it. Be confident in yourself. If you have confident issues act like you own the place. Never let your emotions make you act in ways that can be deemed foolish. Never take your own life. No matter how upset you are. Emotions are fluid and they will pass. Grief is aweful but it does get better. So are hard and good times. Never let love make you do stupid things. I write this as an incredibly stressed and somewhat depressed young man. My mind is enveloped in my feelings and I feel like it wont end. It will, and life will become joyful again. Something I live by is if you feel like your going through hell act like you own the place. It is best to stay away from all substances regardless of how natural they are. I have learned that every single person I have watched used any sort of substances, especially to help regulate emotions/or remove them from the pain of reality has either died, or destroyed their life by themselves or with others. 

**Respect**- give everyone the respect they dont deserve. Reddit doesnt give me enough room to express how much this has not only saved my butt from bad situations, but elevated me above my peers even when I dont deserve it. From that insignificant person at the gas station to the principal of your school, give them the same respect you would if your life was in their hands. From potential legal trouble, to getting recommended by the teachers I despised, my dedication to loving my neighbor has helped me win more than I should have. Do not let anyone walk over you. Remove yourself from bad situations respectfully, always know your worth, always keep your cool and make sure you are not taken advantage of. Stand up for those who need help. Do not gossip, speak well of others and avoid those who dont. Respect everyone regardless of their beliefs, life choices, physical or mental attributes, sexuality, religion, nationality, origin, political leaning etc even if they make you uncomfortable. The actions of most people disagree, however I can attest that people have an amazing ability to rally around and help those who are different than them, if they they feel that person makes an effort to be good to them. Reputation is everything, you come into this world with nothing, and leave with only that. Listen more than you speak

**You live by cancel culture you WILL die by cancel culture** No one lives to escape its devious grasps. Give grace to those even if you dont think they deserve it. We all have our skeletons in the closet

**Fighting** - avoid fights at all costs. Unless you are backed into a corner and your safety is on the line avoid them. Remember this one saying, most people dont want to fight you, they want to hit you- Joe Rogan. Choose your battles and carefully and keep this in mind. Being considered a wimp as a teenager matters as much as a fart in a field. Fights are dangerous and leave people maimed and dead regularly. People dont care these days and they like to see others hurt. They are not worth the legal trouble or loss of reputation. If you must fight to avoid bullying make sure it is 10000% unavoidable and worth it. I personally have fought bullies and almost been arrested. My bullies stopped and I avoided legal trouble bc my administration knew me as highly respectful. Unfortunately, you are not in your parents' time. The poor choices you make now will be seared into societys memories and follow you for eternity. If you must fight, fight justly, with unavoidable reason and with confidence. Swing with a closed fist, thumb closed up and resting underneath your palm(NOT STICKING OUT), using the bottom of your palm/wrist to strike will also work, protect your chin, DO NOT FIGHT ON HARD SURFACES, ladies ball up your hair. Dont go to the ground unless you know how. Your punches will feel like jelly but that is your adrenaline helping you not feel as much pain. Jiu jitsu and Muay Thai kick boxing are often revered as the most practical and most worth your money for training. I can attest to this as well.

(If you live in an environment that forces you to fight often, you know better than I do, and my best advice is to fight with good fundamentals. Use discernment and avoid bad situations.) 

**Discipline**- discipline is the difference between those who succeed vs those who fail in life. Master your urges so that you do not need to itch them. Including and especially sexual urges even if it is difficult. They will take you further than you wanna go and can lead to many bad things in life including wasted time and medical problems. Rid yourself of your vices. Do not be reckless, have fun, live is too short to be reserved by calculate your choices. Despite what people might say, do not chase sex with droves of people even in your young years, enjoy it with the one person who matter most. Those who are guided by sex, I have typically watched, ruin their lives legally, socially, and they begin to sexualization everything. It makes them repulsive to everyone, even if those around them dont mention it. Life is way better when you arent looking at everything and everyone through horny eyes. Wake up at a reasonable time and get life started, even if its reading or working out. Eat well and exercise to the best of your abilities, this will pay off later. Stop making excuses, make a change. Schedule your life in a writing and budget. Living arbitrarily leads to forgetfulness, failure and mistakes. Your death and the life remembered will likely be a 100% reflection of your life. Your habits almost always control your destiny and your death.

**Quality over quantity**- this applies to everything in life. This is most included in friendships. Do not chase the popular kid life. They typically flop after highschool or college. Find a few good friends in life who aim to help you succeed. Do not align yourself with fringe online ideologies. If you need help with dating, or life in general , find a wise older person/mentor in your life to give you quality wisdom, not a comment section filled with tons of ideas unspecific to your life and reality. Cultivate your relationships. People are here for a season. Nothing is permanent. Tell your people you love them and always keep them in your heart. When the world rejects you or the heat turns up, all you have are close family and friends. Quality over quantity.

**Your future** I live in a western world where college is pushed on young people. I do not know what it is like for those not in a western nation so I apologize if this is unrelatable. Do not allow yourself to be force fed into the school to college machine, unless you are more than certain it is for you. Overall, when planning your future it can be scary. It can be hard to try and do risk assessment. It is for this reason that it is crucial to have the wisdom of those whose lives speak with actions. They can help you, no one can do it alone, not even you. If it helps, when making decisions try to think long term. See which option has the best long term results, and then research how badly it would affect your life if that option failed. Weigh them. Use the wise opinions of others with lives that prove their value. The world and their opinion is constantly changing. It is best to have a stable moral compass that can survive the fluidity of the worlds right and wrong. Many people find religion to be helpful in this manner. Me personally a Christ follower. But to each his own

Also, it helps learn how to be handy and fix things. Learn how they work so repairmen cant scam you

**Edit: I think Ill add my two cents on dating after some requests**
This all depends on culture, place of origin, sexuality and desires but I have found this relatively true. I am a straight male in a western world so and this is what I have learned. Nothing comes from a place of hurt or intention to offend

**Assuming you are a straight guy** Id advise you to see what attracts women. Women are the queens of what women want. However what they often say may be slightly different from what their beliefs in practice say. Take this with a grain of salt. Make friends with women and it will help you learn from them. They, like anyone can be ridiculous at times so being around them will help you get first hand experience. Regardless of what the Im so woke and kind and I love everyone and everything is love fake people tell you, the vast majority of women have strong preferences. Although all are not the same the vast majority like relatively in shape men who can provide and protect to some extent along with making her feel loved and appreciated. Low self esteem gets you nowhere with them. **THEY ARE PEOPLE NOT OBJECTS. They are daughters and mothers etc. Do not use them for sex or gratification. They will know and never trust you if you do this. A big fuck you to those who use women for their own pleasure** Douchebags tend to use alpha a beta when describing men. Women tend to be more sensitive than men so keep this in mind. (Look up spaghetti girls, waffle guys. It may give you some insight) Some combo of all this. Build yourself up in these areas. so remember dont focus your life around getting laid or else it may come back to bite you in the butt, badly. My personal preference is to wait until marriage. If thats not for you I wont force it on you but Ive learned its best to keep your body count as low as possible, even women dont like man hoes. In practice even the most modern and feminist women like traditionalist men who ask women out and pay for dates. Avoid the virtue signaling new age stuff and stick to what is tried and true. As Kanye West once said, one good girl is worth a thousand bitches, that is absolute facts. **DO NOT ATTACH YOURSELF TO FRINGE DATING IDEOLOGIES LIKE MGTOW, INCEL, ETC**. Bad people exist just like good people. Yes I will generalize and tell you that it will make you despise women and see them as a scourge on the Earth, they are not your enemy, they are your friends and partners. If you dislike or generalize the other sex, you have failed, miserably at life itself. **Use a mentor to help you navigate. Im barely older than you and a older women or mans advice may better suit you!** 

**For my straight western ladies**
Men typically like fit and friendly women who are happy. We do not care if you have a PHD or a college. We want a good companion who will help us along in life. We are simple and dont think as complicated as you all. The world is tough on us and being able to have a loving companion who lets us be vulnerable secretly means the world to us. Do not let the rampant porn culture than is plaguing men make you insecure about your bodies. Find a man who is invested in you, not women on a screen. Never settle but dont have unrealistic expectations and standards. No one is intimated by a strong woman or man for that matter. If you say this you have already failed. It is likely your disposition. Same goes for men. Sometimes men get uncomfortable rejecting you and it comes off as fearful. Men are the Kings of what men want, NOT WOMEN. Many western women think its their place to convince men to like what they believe they should like. Investing your energy in building yourself according to reality, not Twitter belief systems, this is how you move to the front of the line. Genuine apologies mean the world to us as many of us are taught to take BS from women without resisting. We wont be vulnerable around you unless we trust you. If you go behind our backs with our deep feelings we will never forget, even if we forgive.  The best way to know what men want is to be around men and learn from them. Securing womens rights is your right as a human, however, I feel confident in generalizing to say avoid or be cautious around any 3rd and later wave of feminism. Many parts of it will convince you to despise men. Men are your partners in life, not enemies. Bad people are bad, good are good. If you despise or generalize one gender if people you have failed miserably at life. An older wise mentor will give better more specific vice than I can. Message me if you need anything else. Good luck 

Good luck to you all, I love you all and hope you win at this wild and wondrous game we all call life.","teenagers",387,"https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/mwnscg/i_am_in_my_last_hour_as_a_teenager_i_wanted_to/"

&gt;Now Ive been extremely patient and made it a point to not jump to any premature conclusions about Ye&amp; his antics... Partially due to the lessons learned from the outcome of other similar situations dealing wit my brother Wayne (which I admittedly mishandled a bit in hindsight) But now this shit is next level,futuristic Sambo,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!! From what I can gather... This is the most repulsive,disgraceful, 
Embarrassing act of desperation &amp; auctioning off of ones soul to gain power Ive ever seen. Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally)... but bro... if aintime I wouldve been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence,I feel that Id be compelled to slap deFuq outta you bro For the People!!! You ass kissing and boot licking on a whole new level &amp;I refuse to associate myself with something so vile,weak,&amp; inconsiderate to the effect this has on the greater good of ALL OUR PEOPLE!!!! Im a true believer in It aint what you do,its how you do it. And this shit is regurgitating>.! At one time it was a pleasure to work alongside you... now, Im ashamed to have ever been associated with you.
To all the people who follow Ye musically,socially, or even personally....who are confused, heartbroken, infuriated.... Let me make this clear... THIS SHIT AINT COOL!!! THIS IS A MOVE YE MADE FOR YE!!! THIS IS A PLAY TO PUT HIM IN A POSITION HED LIKE TO SEE HIMSELF IN...WE ARE NOT ON HIS MIND AS HE MAKES THESE COMMENTS AND DECISIONS. Dont follow this puppet. Because as long as Ive lived Ive learned that it benefits a man nothing at all to gain the world,if to do so he must lose his soul. We just saw Mr.Wests Soul on auction.

First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. 

There are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.

She is not a role model, she is a ""mean girl"" bully in disguise and everyone is falling for it.","**UPDATE** on the situation if you care. [This](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.etonline.com/big-machine-records-offices-shut-down-due-to-threats-amid-taylor-swift-feud-136467%3famp) article says that big machine had to shut down their office yesterday because Taylor fans were sending death threats. The article also quotes a label exec saying: 

&gt; Taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog, past and present, at the AMAs. Big Machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesnt have the right to block her. Labels cant block any artists from performing any songs live.

So take it however you will. Lots of cool and differing opinions in here and Ive enjoyed reading them. Thanks for participating you guys =Â•

(**Original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the [recent news](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about Taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

Taylor Swift is always playing the victim. Almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

Example. She put [Joe Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mNeKI) on blast over their breakup. Told everyone on Ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. But Joe Jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

Ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. Surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

Nope. I'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. Examples:  John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal.

Look at her feuds with other celebrities. Kanye and Katy Perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, the list goes on.

Look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. She has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

And didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? Didn't it come out that Taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? It seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

Now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. She is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

It definitely could be true. And I do feel bad for her if that's the case.

But she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. Worth half a billion dollars. She could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). I get that people think this is an important message to spread. But the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

Taylor Swift reminds me of a high schooler. Her ""squad"" is a clique and she is their Regina George. She has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

Taylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. Nah Taylor, you're the problem. The common factor in all these situations is you.

"CMV: US presidential candidates should take an exam covering US government and law, foreign policy, as well as undergo a comprehensive cognitive exam.","2020-07-06",1594032261,"CMV: US presidential candidates should take an exam covering US government and law, foreign policy, as well as undergo a comprehensive cognitive exam.","Edit: Ok, this has been fun and some great conversation, but I am beginning to feel like a one-man army trying to defend the gates of Sparta. 

I have changed my mind for three reasons. 

1) Test-taking ability is not necessarily an indication of one's ability to run the office of the president. 

2) He who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry. 

3) Freedom of speech is a slippery slope, and even though announcing one's intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused, you can't knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact. Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. 

I still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. 

Regardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! 

---- Original Post ----

The office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. 

To limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. 

The results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.

While these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.","changemyview",1184,"https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/hm5di9/cmv_us_presidential_candidates_should_take_an/"

There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All thats left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.""","&gt;My Take: I couldnt be prouder of Shaq, Charles, and Reggie for their bold and straightforward comments. They are at the forefront of Black athletes that are condemning the recent antisemitic social media posts by Kyrie Irving and Ye (Kanye West). Its a genuine I am Spartacus moment.

&gt;The NBA Players Association also released a statement on Nov. 1: Anti-Semitism has no place in our society. The NBPA is focused on creating an environment where everyone is accepted. We are committed to helping players fully understand that certain words can lead to hateful ideologies being spread We will continue to work on identifying and combatting all hate speech wherever it arises.

&gt;Yet, Irving has been defiant about his postings. You can read his long, rambling, at times contradictory defense here. Mostly he reveals his lack of awareness of how history works. Its not an all-you-can-eat buffet from which you can pluck just the dishes you like without any understanding of the context.

&gt;His inability to understand why his posts are news can be seen in this statement: Theres things being posted every day. Im no different from the next human being, so dont treat me any different. You guys come in here and make up this powerful influence that I have (and say) you cannot post that. Why not? Why not? If he really thinks someone with millions of followers spouting hate speech is the same as Jim in accounting posting on Facebook, then he really is out of step with reality.

&gt;The Nets finally forced Irving to acknowledge the damage hes done and donate $500,000 to groups opposing hate speech. In his statement you can almost hear his arm being twisted: I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day. I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility."" But there was no explicit apologywhich tells us everything about what he really believes.

&gt;Honestly, theres little hope that he will change because hes insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All thats left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.

&gt;Kareem Note: The problem of antisemitism is much bigger than Irving or Ye. They are merely the unwitting spokesperson for the right-wing political movement that is blatantly taking over the GOP. (For the full story, read Jewish leaders call on GOP candidates to reject antisemitic comments). Many Republican candidates running for some of the most powerful positions in their states and in the countrysuch as Pennsylvanias GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastrianofeel perfectly free to publicly spout antisemitic statements without fear of reprisal from their own party or the voters. That should be a very troubling sign for all marginalized groups because fascists always start by demonizing one groupright before they go after the others.

"WIBTA if I reported my daughters teacher for not pronouncing her name correctly?","2020-10-22",1603391804,"WIBTA if I reported my daughters teacher for not pronouncing her name correctly?","
My daughters English teacher refuses to pronounce her name correctly. 
She has a Japanese name and we live in Japan.  Her name is Kanae, pronounced Kaa-Naa-EH.
Recently, Kanae told me that her English teacher(an expat from America) at school calls her Kah-Nye. She told me that she told the teacher My name Kanae. Its three claps (syllables). But the English teacher told Kanae that she was incorrect, and that grammatically speaking that she , her teacher, was correct.
During my daughters sports day I confronted the teacher . I explained that my daughter would like the be called Kaa-naa-eh. But she laughed and said she was pronouncing it the way its supposed to be but will try her best to remember.
Today, my daughter told me the teacher still calls her Kah-Nye. My daughter is very very shy and it took a lot for her to correct her teacher the first time.  

Im considering going to the school in the  morning. But is that an over reaction?



(For some clarity; I am not Japanese, my wife is so our kids are mixed-race. Our kids are fluent in English and Japanese. )
>Ãš<Ã¿B>Ãš<Ã¿B

=I<Ã½Not like Kanye West

But Kah. Plus Nye like Bill Nye =H<Ã¼

:::::oh wow! I wrote this late at night and went to sleep. I didnt expect it to get this much attention! Thank you for all of the responses. I cant reply to them all. But this morning we couldnt go(son had an earache) but we are going there after school ends. We asked our daughter if she wanted us to tell. She said that she didnt care.  We dont want the teacher fired, we just want our daughter respected in her classroom::
Ã©Ã©
Update: Im not sure where else to place it:::

But my wife and I went to the school today around 3:45pm. By then the English teacher in question had gone home. 
We told the principal everything that Ive told you all and he was extremely apologetic. He did say that maybe it was a language barrier. But I reminded him that my daughter and I both told the teacher in English how to pronounce Kanae.

So then the principal called her dispatch company (Interac it turns out). The same thing happened. The company apologized but tried to pass it off as a language barrier thing.

More apologizes were issued when we told them
we spoke English. 

We were told that interac would speak to the teacher, and that they would handle it.

They principal asked us to come to the school Monday morning. Im hoping to talk to the teacher face to face on that day.

d=ÂšFinal (maybe) update.  This morning I met with the school board, principal, the dispatch company, and the teacher in question! I honestly didnt expect everyone there. 

It was very traditional Japanese apology. Deep bows from everyone (even the American teacher). She wrote (I think it was written for her because it didnt sound natural and she made several mistakes)

I dont remember it word for word but it said 

 I sincerely apologize to the (our family name) and most sincerely to Kanae(she said it correctly). I now realize how important names are to the Japanese people. Please accept my dearest condolences(yes this was actually said).
The teacher promised to treat Kanae with more respect.
She also apologized for not respecting me during the sports day. 

Honestly the only real thing that she said is when Kanae was brought in and the teacher kneeled down and said Kanae. I am really sorry. 
It seemed heartfelt 

Kanae being Kanae made the teacher a card

I forgive her.  So does my daughter. I have no idea what is going to happen career wise however.  Her company seemed very very upset.

But my daughter feels better
